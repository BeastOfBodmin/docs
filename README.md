features:
    - title: Simplicity
      details: Time is money. Especially in trading! Which is why every feature in Jesse has been designed to be super easy to get started with. In fact, you'll be able to get started in only a few minutes.
    - title: HFT
      details: Thanks to Jesse's ability to connect to markets via a real-time connection, it allows you to trade both candlesticks and the current price (high-frequency trading). 
    - title: Statistics 
      details: A fully functional and automated statistics system to get useful info about your strategy. PNL, R, expectancy, etc. Also, you'll get logs for trades and orders per backtest. 
    - title: Time Frame(s)
      details: Professional traders know it is essential to use more than one time frame at the same time. You need to be able to say "Look for long trades only when the bigger time frame is bullish."
    - title: Orders
      details: Jesse supports all types of standard market orders for both "live trade" and "back test" modes. That includes "MARKET", "LIMIT", "STOP", and even "TRAILING-STOP". 
    - title: Symbol(s) 
      details: It is a basic risk-management rule to trade more than one asset at the same time. This "easy-to-say" feature is something algo-trading bots and platforms have been missing for long.

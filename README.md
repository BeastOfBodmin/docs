    - title: Multiple Time Frames 
      details: If you've every manually traded on markets, you know the value of trading with multiple timeframes. It is crucial to be able to say "when BTC is bullish in 3h time-frame, look for long trades in 15m time-frame."

This "easy-to-say" feature is something algo-trading bots and platforms have been missing for long.

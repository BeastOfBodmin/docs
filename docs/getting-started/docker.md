# Docker

In case you don't have the required stack installed on your machine, [Docker](https://docker.com/) is the fastest way to get you started. 

Of course there's not just one correct way to use Docker, there's plenty. In this page however we'll describe one way step by step.

<!-- ## Image

First, pull the jesse image:
```
docker pull sullyfischer/jesse-ai:python38
```

Now let's 
```
# run it for the first time
docker run -it --name jesse sullyfischer/jesse-ai:python38 /bin/bash
# to reattach to created container 
docker restart jesse && docker exec -it jesse bash
# start Redis and PostgreSQL
sudo service postgresql start && sudo service redis-server start
``` -->

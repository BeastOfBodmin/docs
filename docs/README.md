# What is Jesse? 
Jeses is an advanced algo-trading framework which helps you to write trading strategies, tune, backtest, and trade them on live markets.

## Why do I need it?
If you have ever tried developing an algo-trading system by yourself, or have heard others' experience, then you already know that it takes 6-24 months to get started. Hedge funds spend up to millions for such robust systems. With Jesse, you can skip all of that, and focus on your trading strategies.

Jesse is 100% open-source, and 100% free. However, you do have to meet the requirements by Jesse's license which is "AGPL".

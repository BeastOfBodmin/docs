## Can I trade multiple pairs at once? 

Yes! Jesse has been built to support trading multiple pairs at once. All you need to do is to simply define multiple trading routes in your `routes.py` file. Read the documentation page about [routes](/docs/routes.html#trading-multiple-routes) for details and examples.

Additionally, you can use the data of any other symbol (even multiple) while trading a certain symbol. For example, you can trade `ETH-USD` but also have access to price data of `BTC-USD`. Read the documentation page for [extra candles](/docs/routes.html#using-multiple-time-frames) if you're interested in that.

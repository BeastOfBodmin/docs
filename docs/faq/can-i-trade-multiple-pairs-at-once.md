# Can I trade multiple pairs at once? 

Yes! Jesse has been built to support trading multiple pairs at once. All you need to do is to simply define multiple trading routes in your `routes.py` file. Read the documentation page about [routes](/docs/routes.html#trading-multiple-routes) for details and examples.

Not only that, but you can also use merely the data of other symbols while trading another symbol. For example, you can trade `ETHUSD` but also have access to price data of `BTCUSD`. Read the documentation page for [extra candles](/docs/routes.html#using-multiple-time-frames) if you're interested in that.

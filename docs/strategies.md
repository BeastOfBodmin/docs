# Strategies

Jesse ships with a number of pre-built strategies. Whether they are profitable or not for your purposes, it doesn't really matter. Jesse's API for defining your custom strategies is where it shines indeed.

## Custom strategies

To get started, run:

```
# AwesomeStrategy is the name of your strategy and could be anything
jesse make:strategy AwesomeStrategy
```

This will generate `AwesomeStrategy` class located at `strategies/AwesomeStrategy/index.ts` with bunch of pre-written code inside it.
